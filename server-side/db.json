      "description": "In the heyday of early-’60s surf rock, Fender and several guitarists were on a quest to uncover the perfect Strat sound. Everything from the newly manufactured Alnico III single-coil pickup down to the nitro gloss finish was manipulated with the goal of distilling Stratocaster tone like no other. With the American Vintage II Strat, Fender has now brought back the quintessential 1961 model with unparalleled authenticity. Built with alder and maple, and rosewood tonewoods and featuring an exclusive trio of single-coil Strat pickups, the ’61 Strat is a perfect emulation of a beloved axe classic. Considering it retains the same “C” neck profile and familiar fretboard access, holding an American Vintage II guitar feels akin to wielding an instrument rife with legendary 20th-century tone.",

      "description": "Straight out of Ibanez's Axe Design Lab, the J Custom RG8870 is packed to the gills with exclusive features. It all starts with an alder body, which is chambered for lighter weight and extra resonance, and topped with eye-grabbing flamed maple.

Reaching the upper frets on this solidbody electric guitar feels effortless, thanks to its deep, beveled lower horn scoop and all-access neck joint. DiMarzio's Tone Zone, True Velvet, and PAF 36th Anniversary pickups push your amp to get crunchy rhythms and hot leads, with a coil-tap switch thrown in for maximum sonic versatility. Beyond that, you can bend, twist, and dive-bomb with impunity, courtesy of an Edge-Zero tremolo. Gotoh machine heads and strap lock pins put the perfect finishing touches on the Ibanez J Custom RG8870",
